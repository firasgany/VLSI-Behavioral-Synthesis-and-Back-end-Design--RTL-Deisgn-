# VLSI-Works-Behavioral-Synthesis-and-Back-end-Design.

Implementing a complete design ﬂow of an 8-bit MIPS microprocessor using a given RTL description of it. Starting from behavioral synthesis we will follow the whole design ﬂow up to a ﬁnal layout, covering delay/power/area optimization, ﬂoorplaning, partitioning, place and route and design veriﬁcation.
